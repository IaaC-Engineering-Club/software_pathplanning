## Tasks:
>**2025-04-11:** <br>
>>>Create a logic for the hardware and also create test files for each hardware
>>>PWM
>>>PixHawk
>>>IMU
>>>GPS reader .<br>
>>>**status:** `In process`<br>
>>>**assigned to:** Samarth, Nitsan<br>
>>
>>**observations:** <br>
>>- The script should be able to test the hardware for the respective logic<br>

>**2025-05-12:** <br>
>>>Create path finding logic based on all type of buoys and cardinals <br>
>>>Integrate between CV scripts and path finding <br>
>>>**status:** `Completed`<br>
>>>**assigned to:** Nitsan<br>
>>
>>**observations:** <br>
>>- Integration is done via JSON file output from CV system<br>
>>- A socket-based communication system may be considered for real-time use<br>
>>- All heading corrections are based on real-world distances converted from pixels to cm<br>
